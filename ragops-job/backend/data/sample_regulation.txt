ITAR Section 121.1 - Definition of Significant Parts and Components
(a) General Rule: Any item or technical data designated as a defense article on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) requires an export license unless a specific exemption applies. This includes major platforms, components, parts, accessories, and attachments.

(b) Technical Data Transfer: The release or transfer of technical data (even intangible transfers such as oral communication or visual inspection) to a foreign national within the United States (a 'deemed export') is considered an export for the purposes of this section. 'Technical data' explicitly includes blueprints, design specifications, and manufacturing process sheets.

(c) Compliance and Auditing: All companies engaging in the manufacture or export of defense articles must maintain a comprehensive audit trail for a minimum of five (5) years from the date of the last transaction. This trail must document the disposition and classification of all controlled articles.

AECA Section 202 - Penalties for Non-Compliance
(d) Civil Penalties: Any violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) or its regulations may result in civil fines not to exceed $1,200,000 per violation. The Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), holds primary enforcement authority.

(e) Voluntary Disclosure: In the event of potential non-compliance, companies are strongly encouraged to file a Voluntary Disclosure to the DDTC within 30 days of discovery. Timely and complete disclosure is a significant mitigating factor in the determination of final penalty amounts. This policy applies strictly to self-reported violations only.
